# VMware vSphere As Built Report

# Getting Started
Below are the instructions on how to install, configure and generate a VMware vSphere As Built report.

## Pre-requisites
The following PowerShell modules are required for generating a VMware vSphere As Built report.

Each of these modules can be easily downloaded and installed via the PowerShell Gallery 

- [AsBuiltReport Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/AsBuiltReport/)
- [VMware PowerCLI Module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/VMware.PowerCLI/)

### Module Installation

Open a Windows PowerShell terminal window and install each of the required modules as follows;
```powershell
install-module AsBuiltReport
install-module VMware.PowerCLI
```
## Configuration
The vSphere As Built Report utilises a JSON file to allow configuration of report information, options, detail and healthchecks. 

A vSphere report configuration file can be generated by executing the following command;
```powershell
New-AsBuiltReportConfig -Report VMware.vSphere -Path <User specified folder> -Name <Optional> 
```

Executing this command will copy the default vSphere report JSON configuration to a user specified folder. 

All report settings can then be configured via the JSON file.

The following provides information of how to configure each schema within the report's JSON file.

### Report
The **Report** sub-schema provides configuration of the vSphere report information

| Schema | Sub-Schema | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| Report | Name | The name of the As Built Report
| Report | Version | The report version
| Report | Status | The report release status

### Options
The **Options** sub-schema allows certain options within the report to be toggled on or off

| Schema | Sub-Schema | Setting | Description |
| ------ | ---------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Options | ShowLicenses | true / false | Toggle to mask/unmask  vSphere license keys within the As Built report.<br><br> **Masked License Key**<br>\*\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*\*-\*\*\*\*\*-56YDM-AS12K<br><br> **Unmasked License Key**<br>AKLU4-PFG8M-W2D8J-56YDM-AS12K

### InfoLevel
The **InfoLevel** sub-schema allows configuration of each section of the report at a granular level. The following sections can be set

| Schema | Sub-Schema | Default Setting |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------- |
| InfoLevel | vCenter | 3
| InfoLevel | ResourcePool | 3
| InfoLevel | Cluster | 3
| InfoLevel | VMhost | 3
| InfoLevel | Network | 3
| InfoLevel | vSAN | 3
| InfoLevel | Datastore | 3
| InfoLevel | DSCluster | 3
| InfoLevel | VM | 3
| InfoLevel | VUM | 3

There are 6 levels (0-5) of detail granularity for each section as follows;

| Setting | InfoLevel | Description |
| ------- | ---- | ----------- |
| 0 | Disabled | does not collect or display any information
| 1 | Summary** | provides summarised information for a collection of objects
| 2 | Informative | provides condensed, detailed information for a collection of objects
| 3 | Detailed | provides detailed information for individual objects
| 4 | Adv Detailed | provides detailed information for individual objects, as well as information for associated objects (Hosts, Clusters, Datastores, VMs etc)
| 5 | Comprehensive | provides comprehensive information for individual objects, such as advanced configuration settings

### Known Issues
- Verbose script errors when connecting to vCenter with a Read-Only user account. 
  - A user account with administrator privileges is required to generate a VMware vSphere report.

- In HTML documents, word-wrap of table cell contents is not working, causing the following issues;
  - Cell contents may overflow table columns
  - Tables may overflow page margin
  - [PScribo Issue #83](https://github.com/iainbrighton/PScribo/issues/83)

- In Word documents, some tables are not sized proportionately. To prevent cell overflow issues in HTML documents, most tables are auto-sized, this causes some tables to be out of proportion.
